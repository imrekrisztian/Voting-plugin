## Description

The plugin automatically inserts a voting area at the end of every Article. 

When a user arrives at an Article, he/she can vote by pressing Yes or No buttons.

The voting works with AJAX, so the voting/displaying of the results will happen instantly, and automatically.

After the voting, the user won't be able to vote again since the buttons remain disabled and his IP address is saved.

The site owners can see all the counts and percentages when they access the back-end side of the webpage. The results will be seen when clicking on Posts and editing an Article.
